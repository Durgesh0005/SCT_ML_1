# 🏠 House Price Prediction – ML Task 01

## 🧠 Machine Learning Task 01 – SkillCraft Technology

This is my **first machine learning project** as part of the **SkillCraft Technology** training. The task was focused on **predicting house prices** using various features such as area, number of rooms, location, and more. The objective was to build a **regression model** that accurately estimates housing prices based on historical data.
